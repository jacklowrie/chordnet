# Security Policy

Thank you for your interest in keeping Chordnet secure! As a single-developer project, I appreciate your help in reporting any vulnerabilities you may find.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, **please do not open a public issue**. Instead, email me directly at [castles-modular.3v@icloud.com] with details.

- Provide as much information as possible to help reproduce and address the issue (e.g., steps to reproduce, environment, affected versions, and any relevant logs or screenshots).
- I aim to acknowledge security reports within **7 days**. Resolution or a fix may take longer depending on complexity and my availability, but I will keep you updated.
- If you are able to help fix the issue, that is welcome! We can coordinate through the emailed report.
- Please give me a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before any public disclosure.

## Scope

This policy applies to the Chordnet repository and its published releases. Issues with third-party dependencies should be reported upstream.

## Responsible Disclosure

Please avoid publicly disclosing vulnerabilities without prior coordination. I appreciate your patience and cooperation while I work to resolve any security concerns.

## Out of Scope

- Denial of Service (DoS) via resource exhaustion (unless itâ€™s trivial to prevent)
- Social engineering attacks
- Issues in dependencies not maintained by this project
- Vulnerabilities in projects that use chordnet (where the fix is unique to the project, in the project's source code, and/or not a vulnerability specific to chordnet)
